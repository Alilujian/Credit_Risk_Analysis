# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we use Python and employ different machin leanrning techniques and models to train the unbalanced credit risk classes. In this project, we will use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.
By using credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, we will perform the following:
* oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
* Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
* Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
* Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
At the end, we will evaluate the performance of different models and to determine which model should be use for predicting credit risk in the future dataset.

## Results

### Naive Random Oversampling

### SMOTE Oversampling

### Cluster Centroids Undersampling 

### SMOTEENN Combination Sampling
